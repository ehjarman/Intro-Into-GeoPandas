# Intro-Into-GeoPandas
### Overview
The goal of this project is to use a choropleth map to analyze obesity rates throughout the United States. The data was pulled from data.gov; it contains the following variables: U.S. State Name, State Area, State Obesity Rates (%), and json geographic data structures. 

#### Analysis
The data was first cleaned. Duplicate and null values were checked. For the sake of a prettier map, states outside the continental U.S. were removed.

A bar chart was generated demonstrating the percent of each states population. The calculated United States average obesity rate and the global obesity rate (pulled from WHO) were plotted horizontally.

Lastly, a choropleth map was generated, with a transition from light to dark being an increase in obesity rate.
